We've decided to separate the models we created for fun and the one we created for the assignment. This folder contain our "fun models".

The first model is a simple Text2Image pipeline model, where no significant changes were made to the default setup. The model has just been loaded in and set up with functions and a gradio interface in order for the user to try it out. In future iterations, we might experiment with different kinds of diffusion models, as well as changing up the scheduler within these in order to gain a better understanding of how these parameters/model features work and change the output.
