So for this assignment, we attempted to create an interface for the MLFlow and for the model EDA. We ended up having quite a few issues with the streamlit application, and so the interface we ended up creating was a bit lacking in terms of detail, but there isn't really much to display for the MLFlow for this model.

The folders are set up as such

Database - This folder contains our .db file as well as the setup for this.

Model_EDA - This folder contains the notebooks we used to create the model, perform a quick and dirty basic EDA as well as log the different metrics/artifacts of the model. After this was run, we updated the database file to also contain these elements.

Streamlit - This folder contains the streamlit application file as well as the requirements.txt for running the application.
